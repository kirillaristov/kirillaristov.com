<p class="intro">Rivers â€” are wanderings. These are mysteries, hopes, joys and despair. Rivers are paths to other universes, to virgin worlds.  Rivers are nature and they are the soul. Rivers give a sense of life and teach you to live, they strengthen. Rivers do not keep traces and every person on them is a discoverer.</p>
